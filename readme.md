## Target
Choose a public api of your choice that has options for filtering. This api will be our data source.
Develop the following.
- An endpoint that consumes any public api and returns a list of data.
- The endpoint must have filters of the api that is being consumed, no more than 3 filters.
- An option should be added to download the information in a zip that contains the json.

## Solution
It is basically a wrapper to the Rick & Morty public API (https://rickandmortyapi.com) It adds some extra features like filters, error handling, and downloading the data in ZIP format
